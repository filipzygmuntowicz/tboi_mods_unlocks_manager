Unlocks manager for Binding of Isaac Repentance mods. Currently (almost fully) supporting only Repentance Plus, download it from: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3056942881
The purpose of the manager is to allow for an unlock system for a clean version of the mod. A clean version has the in-game unlocks system removed for improved performance and stability.
Download the .exe from [Releases](https://github.com/filipzygmuntowicz/tboi_mods_unlocks_manager/releases/).

I don't own any of the assets used in the application. They are all taken from the game files.
