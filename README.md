Unlocks manager for Binding of Isaac Repentance mods. Currently (almost fully) supporting only Repentance Plus, download it from: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3056942881
The purpose of the manager is to allow for an unlock system for a clean version of a mod, which is a version with unlocks system removed for improved game performance and stability.

I don't own any of the assets used in the application. They are all taken from the game files.
